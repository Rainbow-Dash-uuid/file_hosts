# File "Hosts"
This is the file "Hosts" In which unnecessary sites are registered, which contain advertising scripts, and other XML with advertising.
After installation, advertising will be less, and there will be less malicious XML scripts.
Installation is done in a fairly simple way:
To do this, download the file "install", and open as administrator. And then restart the PC.
The result will be noticed, Enjoyable use.

# The list of sites will be gradually replenished

Also, Microsoft, Windows telemetry sites will be blocked.

The install.exe file is a WinRAR self-extracting archive containing the Hosts file.

# How it works?
I'll tell you in a simpler language, the sites that are registered there will not work.
